# Titanic-Competition
We use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
* Used a decision tree classifier and a random forest classifier to predict which passengers survive based on four features
* Calculated the cross validation scores for each model
* Calculated the mean of the cross validation scores and found the random forest classifier to be more accurate (with a mean of 0.77106 compared to decision tree models mean of 0.76957)
